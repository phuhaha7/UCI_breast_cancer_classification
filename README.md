# UCI_breast_cancer_classification

This project used data from UCI MAchine Learning repository for Breast Cancer to fit multiple classifiers on the data to find the one with best fit.

Models used were Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Kernel SVM Classifier, KNN Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifer, and Random Forest Classifier.

Accuracy for Logistic Regression: 96.49 % Accuracy for Decision Tree: 92.98 % Accuracy for Kernel SVM: 98.24 % Accuracy for K Nearest Neighbors: 95.61 % Accuracy for Naive Bayes: 90.35 % Accuracy for Random Forest: 97.36 %

As you can see, Kernel SVM gave the best Accuracy.

Data files are attached, the wdbc.txt and its context is contains in the wbdcnames.txt.
